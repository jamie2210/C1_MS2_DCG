## Design

### Design Choices
The design has been influenced by the comics like keeping the buttons square and grey to present comments in comic books. Each game has been designed around the colours and personality of the characters in the comics. 

### Colour

DC uses a specific blue which is used sparingly throughout the website.

Batman colours are predominantly black and yellow.

Both The Riddler and Joker are themed by purples and greens.
